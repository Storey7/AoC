# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for the 2020 edition of [Advent of Code](!https://adventofcode.com/). All done using C++, mostly as a learning exercise. I think the amount of string parsing and list wrangling would make this a far better task for python, but it's been an interesting challenge, and I've learned a lot. 

I was doing each challenge daily until day 16, when Christmas took priority. I'll circle back to this and the other year's challenges throughout 2021. Hopefully by next year I'll have 300 stars.
